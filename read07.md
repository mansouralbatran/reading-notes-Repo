# Functions
*Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
## Defining functions
*A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
* The name of the function
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. 
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
## Calling functions
Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function , you could call it as follows
# Logical operators
|Operator        |	Usage|Description|
|----------------|-------|-----------|
|Logical AND (&&)|expr1 && expr2|Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.|
|Logical OR (//) |expr1 (// expr2|Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values,// returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns fals|
|Logical NOT (!) |!expr|Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true|
