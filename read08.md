# Loops and iteration
* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
* You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

## for statement
* A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.(for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement)

## do...while statement
* The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
* A do...while statement looks as follows:
(do
  statement
while (condition);)
